## Project Description

The personal blog website is designed and developed using HTML and CSS. The website consists of four pages: Home, About, Blog and Post. The Home page contains a brief introduction about the blog, while the About page provides more detailed information about the author. The Blog page displays a list of all blog posts, and the Post page displays the content of a specific blog post.

The website has been developed using proper HTML and CSS formatting and style. All images are custom-designed, and captions have been added to each image. The files have been organized into folders, and appropriate links have been added to navigate between the pages.

## Installation

2. Extract the files to a folder.
3. Open the index.html file in your browser.

## Instructions
